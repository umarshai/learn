<summary>What are Backlinks and Why are They Important?</summary>

**Backlinks** are links from external websites pointing to your site. Search engines view backlinks as a sign of credibility and authority. The more quality backlinks your site has, the higher it is likely to rank.

Key points about backlinks:
- **Quality over Quantity**: A few high-quality backlinks from authoritative sites are better than many low-quality ones.
- **Anchor Text**: The clickable text of a backlink should be relevant to the page being linked to.
- **Avoiding Spammy Links**: Low-quality or spammy backlinks can harm your SEO rather than help.

<details>
<summary>What is Mobile-First Indexing in SEO?</summary>

**Mobile-First Indexing** means that Google predominantly uses the mobile version of your website to rank it in search results. This is because most searches now come from mobile devices.

Key points:
- Ensure your website is **responsive** (adjusts to any screen size).
- Mobile site speed is crucial; slow mobile sites will rank lower.
- The mobile version of the site should contain the same content and structured data as the desktop version.
