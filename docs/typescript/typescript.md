# TypeScript Features

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static typing, modern programming features, and enhanced tooling for scalable application development. Below is a list of its key features:

---

## 1. **Type Annotations**
Allows developers to explicitly define variable, function, and return types for improved code clarity and debugging.

## 2. **Interfaces**
Provides a way to define the structure of objects, ensuring that they follow a specific shape or contract.

## 3. **Classes and Inheritance**
Supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).

## 4. **Generics**
Enables reusable and type-safe components or functions that work with a variety of data types.

## 5. **Enums**
Defines a set of named constants for better code readability and management.

## 6. **Type Aliases**
Allows you to create custom names for types to simplify and improve code readability.

## 7. **Modules**
Supports modular programming by enabling code splitting and importing/exporting functionality.

## 8. **Type Inference**
Automatically infers types based on the assigned values or return values, reducing the need for explicit annotations.

## 9. **Union and Intersection Types**
Provides the ability to combine multiple types using union (`|`) or intersection (`&`) operators.

## 10. **Decorators**
Offers experimental support for metadata annotations on classes, methods, and properties for advanced scenarios like dependency injection.

## 11. **Access Modifiers**
Introduces visibility control for class members using `public`, `private`, and `protected` modifiers.

## 12. **Static Typing**
Adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## 13. **Readonly Modifier**
Ensures that properties cannot be modified after their initial assignment.

## 14. **Utility Types**
Provides built-in types like `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, and `Readonly` to simplify type transformations.

## 15. **Mapped Types**
Allows the creation of new types by transforming existing types.

## 16. **Namespaces**
Supports organizing and encapsulating code within a namespace to prevent global scope pollution.

## 17. **Advanced Type Features**
Includes features like conditional types, keyof operator, type guards, and type assertions for flexible and complex type handling.

## 18. **Null and Undefined Handling**
Offers strict null checking and features like `strictNullChecks` for safer code execution.

## 19. **Tooling Support**
Integrates seamlessly with editors like VS Code, providing features like autocompletion, real-time error checking, and refactoring.

## 20. **Backward Compatibility**
Compiles TypeScript into plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript environments.
